<p class="info-4">My name is Aylin and I'm a 16 year old junior based in NOLA.<br>I started coding last summer through GWC 2025 SIP,
and <br>it was one of the best decisions I've ever made! <br><br> Coding has allowed me to make things I never thought<br> I could make, and I'm really thankful for it.
Through coding,<br>I have met so many amazing people. Through Slack or<br> hackathons, I have met so many people who I love <br> talking to. <br> 
I participated in the Athena Award (I was at Parthenon!) <br> Blueprint (was at Prototype), and currently trying to make <br> it to Athena Award's Sleepover!
<br>Coding is only a part of my many interests! <br> I also love music (K-Pop, RnB, Rap), makeup, dancing, <br> art (trying to learn how to draw), video games, and reading. <br><br>
Some of my favorite games are: Genshin, Pjsk and D4DJ,<br> Minecraft, Roblox, NSO, Melatonin, Stardew Valley, etc.. <br> 
Some of my favorite shows are: Apothecary Diaries, JJK, A<br> Sign of Affection, ALNST, Toradora, Given, Young Sheldon, etc.. <br> 
My favorite artists are: i-dle, keshi, cas, Frank Ocean <br> Tyler, The Creator, ILLIT, LESSERAFIM, Wave to Earth, ect.. <br><br>
I yap so much I'm literally running out of space... <br> So I can't name ALL my favorite characters, <br> but I can show you them! --> </p>
