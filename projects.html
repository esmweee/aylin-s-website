<p class="info-5">I've done a lot of projects like websites and games using <br> 
CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. However, I've been <br> trying to learn how to use Python and GDScript. <br><br>
I feel like some of my projects are really boring.. So <br> I'm always trying to find new ways to improve! <br>
The first project I ever did was a really simple catcher <br> game using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. However, <br> 
it was kinda ass so I'm glad I've improved a bit <br> since then and made cooler stuff! (ദ്ദി ˉ͈̀꒳ˉ͈́ )✧ <br><br> 
I'm currently working on a 3D game using Godot. It's<br>inspired by ACNH and GCGC, it's super fun but difficult so far.. <br> 
I've had to learn how to use a new programming <br> language AND Blender (hell), but I'm sure it'll pay off. <br> 
The game's name will be Catt Cafe (taking suggestions...) <br> and you play as a cat living in a rural town! <br><br>
My github username is @esmweee, in case you wanna <br> have a look at my projects and what I'm currently <br> working on. </p>
